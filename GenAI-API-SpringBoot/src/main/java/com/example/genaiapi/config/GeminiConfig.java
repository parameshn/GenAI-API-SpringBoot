     * What it does: The @Configuration class is a designated place for setting up
     * and configuring application components. By putting the RestTemplate bean
     * there, you centralize its creation and any common configurations it might
     * need (e.g., message converters for JSON/XML, error handlers, interceptors for
     * logging or authentication).
     * Why it's good: If you need to add a new Interceptor for all outgoing
     * RestTemplate calls, or change its timeout settings, you do it in one place
     * (the bean definition), and all parts of your application that use that
     * RestTemplate will automatically pick up the change. If you create new
     * RestTemplate() everywhere, you'd have to update every single location.

     /*
      * Simplifies HTTP calls: No need to write boilerplate code for HTTP
      * connections.
      * 
      * Automatic JSON/XML conversion: Integrates with Spring converters.
      * 
      * Handles errors: Throws exceptions for non-2xx HTTP responses so you can
      * handle them gracefully.
      * 
      * Supports all HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.
      * 
      * Flexible: Allows adding custom headers, cookies, authentication, timeouts,
      * etc.
      *

      /*
       * RestTemplate is synchronous â€” meaning it blocks the calling thread until the
       * HTTP response arrives. For modern apps requiring async or reactive calls,
       * Spring recommends using WebClient (from Spring WebFlux). But RestTemplate
       * remains very popular and easy for many common use cases.
